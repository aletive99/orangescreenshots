I will now give you a list of possible widgets that might come next by using the same format that was used before for the "Widget descriptions". Tell what are the three widgets out of the possible ones I provided that make the most sense to be added next to the workflow and why. The goal we want the new widget to achieve will be specified following this outline:
"Goal of the new widget: GOAL"

Your output should be of the type: 
"POSSIBLE WIDGET1: WHY1

POSSIBLE WIDGET2: WHY2

POSSIBLE WIDGET3: WHY3"
