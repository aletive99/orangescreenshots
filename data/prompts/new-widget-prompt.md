I will now give you a list of possible widgets that might come next by using the same format that was used before for the "Widget descriptions". Tell what are the three widgets out of the possible ones I provided that make the most sense to be added next to the workflow, the percentage probability that the one being considered is the right one, and the reason why you think that is the right one. The goal we want the new widget to achieve will be specified following this outline:
"Goal of the new widget: GOAL"

Your output type has to be that of a yaml file to be read in Python and use the following scheme (replace the PLACEHOLDERS with your output):

"WIDGET NAME:
- PERCENTAGE PROBABILITY OF BEING RIGHT
- This widget would suit the workflow because REASON

WIDGET NAME:
- PERCENTAGE PROBABILITY OF BEING RIGHT
- This widget would suit the workflow because REASON

WIDGET NAME:
- PERCENTAGE PROBABILITY OF BEING RIGHT
- This widget would suit the workflow because REASON"
