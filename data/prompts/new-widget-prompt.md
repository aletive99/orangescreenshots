Given the information provided about the workflow and about the goal we want to achieve, choose three widgets that make the most sense to be added next to the workflow from the possible ones I provided. For each chosen widget report the percentage probability that it is right and the reason why you think it fits the workflow.

Your output type has to be that of a yaml file to be read in Python as a dictionary. Use the following scheme (replace the PLACEHOLDERS with your output):

"WIDGET NAME:
- PERCENTAGE PROBABILITY OF BEING RIGHT
- This widget would suit the workflow because REASON

WIDGET NAME:
- PERCENTAGE PROBABILITY OF BEING RIGHT
- This widget would suit the workflow because REASON

WIDGET NAME:
- PERCENTAGE PROBABILITY OF BEING RIGHT
- This widget would suit the workflow because REASON"
