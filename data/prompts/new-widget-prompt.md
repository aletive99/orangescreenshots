I will now give you give you a list of possible widgets that might be missing or might come next by using the same format that was used before for the "Widget descriptions". Tell what are the three widgets out of the possible ones I provided that make the most sense to be added to the workflow and why.

Your output should be of the type:
"POSSIBLE WIDGET1: WHY1

POSSIBLE WIDGET2: WHY2

POSSIBLE WIDGET3: WHY3"
