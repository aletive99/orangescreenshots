This workflow first loads the data through the Datasets widget. The loaded dataset is then passed down to the Pivot Table which allows us to transform the data into aggregate values. The result of this operation is then passed down to the Select Columns widget which lets us manually compose the dataset. Lastly the modified data is given as input to the Line Plot which allows us to visualize the data profiles. This workflow allows the user to explore different compositions of the dataset to see if any features trend appears.
