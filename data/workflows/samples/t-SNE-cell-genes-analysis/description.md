This workflow first loads a Single Cell Dataset from an online repository. This data is then mapped into two-dimensional space thanks to the t-SNE widget. The dataset is then passed to the Annotator widget which annotates cells with their type based on the Marker Genes which are given by the relative widget. The data with additional columns with annotations, clusters and projection is then visualized through a Data Table. This workflow allows the user to load and visualize a single cell dataset, identify the cell types and visualize them, enhancing the understanding of specific functions and interactions.
