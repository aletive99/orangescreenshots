This workflow first loads a dataset from a local file through the File widget which is then visualized in a Data Table. The data points distances are then calculated thanks to the Distances widget and passed down to both the Distance Map and Hierarchical Clustering widgets. The first allows us to visualize the data distances in a heat map, while the second performs hierarchical clustering on the data. The user can then manually select clusters in the Hierarchical Clustering widget, which are then visualized in a Data Table and in a Box Plot. This workflow allows the user to perform hierarchical clustering on the loaded data and explore the similarities and differences between or within clusters.
