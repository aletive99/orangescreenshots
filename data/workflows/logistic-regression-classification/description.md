This workflow first loads a dataset from a local file through the File widget. The data is passed down to the Test & Score widget which uses it to train the Logistic Regression to perform classification. The Test & Score widget then outputs the evaluation results which are used to create a Confusion Matrix, showing the proportions between well classified data instances and misclassified ones. Finally a Scatter Plot is produced showing both the initial dataset and the manually selected data instances from the confusion matrix. This workflow allows the user to perform logistic regression on the dataset and evaluate the results through the visualization of the predicted classes and their relative features.
